/** This is the Terran implementation of the BuildPlanner class. See BuildPlanner for more details.
 *
 * Terran bot tactics:
 * - The Terran strategy involves using Bunkers with Marines as defense, and attack with a large force
 * containing around 20 Marines, one Medic per five Marines, some Vultures, and at least 2 Siege Tanks
 * with Siege ability researched. Siege tanks with Siege ability is the core of how the bot attacks.
 * Later in the game an air attack force containing a Science Vessel, some Wraiths and Battlecruisers
 * are used. Ghosts are not implemented (yet).
 * If perfect information is disabled, scouting is early in the game performed by Marines or Vultures.
 * Later in the game Wraiths takes over the scouting tasks.
 *
 * Weaknesses:
 * - When engaging the enemy, the attack force tends to be spread out with fast units in the front that
 * does not wait for the heavy but slow tanks to arrive before engaging enemy defense structures.
