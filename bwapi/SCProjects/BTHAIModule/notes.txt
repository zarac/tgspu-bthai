TODO

- Overlord's should explore (and make sure they're out of the way of new buildings)

- Expand (base-wise)

- Spire > mutas (for devourers and guardians)

- Expand onto islands

- Fix unit movement in fight (should fall back then surround at inner side of choke point, forcing enemy to enter through choke point)

- Lurker upgrade

- Not all larvas seem to be used.
